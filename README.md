Source Code Repository Tools[GITHUB] 
Version Control Softwares[GIT]
================================

-> Multiple developers will work for project development

-> Developers will be working from multiple locations

-> All developers code should be stored at one place (Code Integration Should Happen)

-> To integrate all the developers source code at one place we will use Source Code Repository Softwares


============================================
Advantages with Source code repository sofwares
============================================

1) All the developers can connect to repository server and can integrate the code

2) Code Integration will become easy

3) Repository server will provide monitored access

Repository Tools
==============

SVN (outdated)

Git Hub

BitBucket


=================================
Environment Setup to work with Git Hub
=================================

1) Create Github account ( www.github.com )

2) Download and install Git Client software ( https://git-scm.com/downloads )

3) Once installation completed, right click on the mouse and verify git options display (If git options displaying our git client installation completed successfully)


=====================
Working with GitHub
=====================

-> Login into github account with your credentials

-> Create Repository in github

Note: Repository is used to store project source code. Every Project will have one repository

-> When we create a repository, unique URL will be generated with Repository Name (i.e Repo URL)
